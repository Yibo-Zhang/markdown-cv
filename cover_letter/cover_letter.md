Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Scientist/Engineer position at Broadcom. My experience in developing and deploying production-ready AI solutions, particularly in machine learning and NLP, aligns perfectly with your requirements.

My recent work on the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD) project involved building machine learning pipelines that achieved 90% accuracy in multi-class classification, as well as developing scalable ETL pipelines and REST APIs. This experience demonstrates my ability to deliver impactful AI solutions.

In another project, GPTArticleExtractor, I designed NLP pipelines leveraging LLMs to process 22,000+ scientific papers, engineered vector embedding systems for semantic search, and achieved 83% accuracy in automated information extraction. This showcases my proficiency in GenAI techniques and prompt engineering, relevant to Broadcom's development of AI assistants.

Additionally, my work on deep learning for vector field reconstruction involved developing custom neural network architectures with ResNet backbone and implementing coordinate transformation pipelines, demonstrating my ability to handle complex computational challenges and optimize deep learning models.

I am particularly drawn to Broadcom's focus on developing AI assistant expert systems for network operations. My experience and passion in machine learning, NLP, and GenAI, combined with my track record of delivering production-ready systems, make me well-suited to contribute to your team's success.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience could benefit Broadcom. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,\
Yibo Zhang
